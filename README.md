# Brain Tumor Classification
- Based on the Kaggle Competition [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification)
- The aim is to predict the status of a genetic biomarker (MGMT promoter methylation) which is important for brain cancer treatment.
- MGMT promoter methylation is the key mechanism of MGMT gene silencing and predicts a favorable outcome in patients with glioblastoma who are exposed to alkylating agent chemotherapy.
