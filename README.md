# Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification
 [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/slm37102/brain-tumor-classification/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/slm37102/brain-tumor-classification) [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=slm37102_Brain-Tumor-Classification&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=slm37102_Brain-Tumor-Classification) ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=your-github-username)

- This app is based on a Kaggle competition called [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification), which is organized by Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).
- The app aims to predict the status of a genetic biomarker (MGMT promoter methylation) which is important for choosing the brain cancer treatment.
- MGMT promoter methylation is the key mechanism of MGMT gene silencing and predicts a favourable outcome in patients with glioblastoma who are exposed to alkylating agent chemotherapy.

- The model training is done using [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/slm37102/t1w-brain-tumor-eca-nfnet-l2-5-epoch)
- The model is trained based on [this competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification)

TODO:
- Multimodel
- prediction to API
- add more detail to README.md(model training etc)
